## README
This is a webserver server that displays microsoft-docs for offline use, with search capabilities!
It uses `flask` as the backend, and `whoosh` for the indexing & search feature.

## Setup
To setup the server, clone all of the docs you want to save for offline use from `https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs` and save them all in the same folder.
